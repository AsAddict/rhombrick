# rhombrick

A 3d tiling engine that tiles space with rhombic dodecahedrons.

This is a little project for me to experiment with graphics in Clojure using the [Quil](https://github.com/quil/quil) library. The tile assembler algorithm was inspired by the algorithm described in [Paul Harrison's thesis](http://www.logarithmic.net/pfh/thesis).

Clone the repo then do: lein deps; lein run.

Some of the code is ad hoc and ugly and definately shouldn't be taken as an example of good Clojure code.
