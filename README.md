# rhombrick

Implements a tiling algorithm that tiles 3d space with rhombic dodecahedral blocks.

This is a little project for me to experiment with graphics in Clojure using the [Quil](https://github.com/quil/quil) library.

The tile assembler algorithm was inspired by the algorithm described in [Paul Harrison's thesis](http://www.logarithmic.net/pfh/thesis). I found this algorithm fascinating and wanted to try and extend it to work in three dimensions. 

Clone the repo then do: lein deps; lein run.

Some of the code is ad hoc and ugly and definately shouldn't be taken as an example of good Clojure code.
